# Java Basics

## Java Basics
- Real-world objects contain state and behavior.
- A software object's state is stored in field.
- A software object's behavior is exposed through method.
- Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through publicly exposed methods is known as data encapsulation.
- A blueprint for a software object is called a class.
- Common behavior can be defined in a inheritance and inherited into a class using the extends keyword.
- A collection of methods with no implementation is called an interface.
- A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a package.
- The term API stands for application interaction interface.
- the java is object oriented language
- there is four variables category in Java:
1. Class variables
1. Instance variables
1. Parameters 
1. Local variables
- there is 8 types of primitive variables (short,tall,char,int,double,float,byte,boolean)
- the decimal digit number is the digit system that most likely we will use
- the array is an object that store the variables value inside it
- to manipulate the arrays you can use classes that can make the dealing with arrays easier
- Operators in Java it's like the operators in javaScript there is something new which is the instanceof operator compares an object to a specified type and return true or false
- The best practice that making the operators unambiguous, so you or anyone will read your code don't get confused in operations priority
- The branching statements are (break, continue, return)
- The for loop in java it's exactly like the for loop in javaScript bust i learned something new which is enhanced for statement,ie: ` for (int oneItem: array) {
    // you can iterate in every item throw "oneItem"
} `

## compiling code
- The computer understands just the computer language which is [0,1], and that's in real life on off voltage in the transistor.
- To make the programmer's life easier the human invented the programming language which is easy to understand because it has some English language words.
- To make the computer understand what the programmer is writing the programming language has to convert to computer language.
- The process of converting programming language to computer language called compiling.
