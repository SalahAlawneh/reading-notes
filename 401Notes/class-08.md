# OO Design
## The SOLID Principles:
- `"S" ==> ` single responsibility principle: means that the class have to do just one thing, to make the editing easy.
- `"O" ==> ` open/closed principle: that mean when you create a claas it have to me closed for modification, because it's too good to do it's purpose, at the same time it has to be open for extension like using it to inhertent.
- `"L" ==> ` liskov substitution principle: mean that every child have to stand to his parent methods without any weird stuff happenning.
- `"I" ==> ` interface segregation principle: it's better to use many smaller interface than using huge one, with alot of not related things.
- `"D" ==> ` dependency inversion: using abstraction class is better than using classes have every detail to lett another classes use their features.
