## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
- decisions could be made in JavaScript with if statement, which is make the code do the order just if the condition happen.
- we can use else to make the order happen if the condition did not happen.
- loops used in two way:
1. for loop: used when we know the number of time i want to do the order.
1. while loop: used when i want to make the order again and again until the condition will be wrong.
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
