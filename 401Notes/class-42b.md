## Big Data
- talking about data there is a huge amount of data, and there is a lot of ways dealing with it, there is an fast one and there is big data and there is a variety of dealing with it.
- in big data, the data collected in really huge amount without any analyzing at first, after that the analyze will accure.
- talking about this data and creating a schema from it is huge thing, we talk about data in every aspect and there is a critical part of it wich is the data about people.
- from the data about some body, you can know his religon his race, and use that for any pupose.
- you expect the data to use just for selling thing you are intersted in and maybe you will not expect any farther usage.
- talking about the ethics in this part is huge and there is a lot of disscusion about it, and i recommend this book for any one intersted and what we know about people using big data [Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gBViHUDYD0) and this is an dicussion for some ideas from the book.
## The code I’m still ashamed of
- in this story there is a lot of lessons to learn, but for me i think the first idea come to my mind, even if i'm an Employee i have the responsibilty in every action i do and every line of code i write, always i have to make sure i will not do any harm for any body.
