- The properties that allow you to control
the appearance of text can be split into
two groups:
1. Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,
and the size of the text)
1. Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters)
- The font-family property
allows you to specify the
typeface that should be used for
any text inside the element(s) to
which a CSS rule applies.
- The font-size property enables
you to specify a size for the
font. There are several ways to
specify the size of a font. The
most common are: 
1. pixels
1. percentage
1. ems
- make your font size about 16 px and another sizes relativly to this value.
- The text-align property allows
you to control the alignment of
text. The property can take one
of four values:
1. left
1. right 
1. center
1. justify
