# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING and REFACTORING
- functionality programming is a way of writing code, that deal with things as mathemateical functions.
- Our focus to this point were about object oriented programmin.
- Pure function is a function that will return the same value, if it given the same argument `deterministic function`
- mutability it's not recommended in functional programming
- reading extrenal thing inside function and random functions are not pure functions.
- Pure functios is easier to work with
- immutable, mean that the function don't change
- Referential transparency `pure function + immutable data = referetial transparency`
- functions in the code are values and used like data
- the higher order function is the function that take a function as an argument
- the callback function is function that passed iside another function`higher order function`


## REFACTORING
- the purpose of refactoring is:
  - performance
  - readability
- try to make your code from the beginning at it's best, becase sometimes in companyies you will not have time to refacotor things.
- to make your code as neat as possible:
  - Return early from functions
  - Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences
  - Check for Web APIs before implementing your own functionality
