## Domain Modeling

- Domain Modeling: the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors and the the constraints that govern the problem domain.

- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.

- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.

- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.

- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.

- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.

- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

## HTML Tables
- A table represents information in a grid format .

- To create a teable in HTML we use < table> then < tr> to start new row then < td> to represent each cell .
- use < th> for table heading .
- **To spanning columns or** use < td colspan="x" > x indicate how many cell should run across it .
- **To spanning rows** use  < td rowspan="y"> y indicate how many cell should run across it .
- for long tables use < thead> ,< tbody> ,  < tfoot>
## JS Constructor Functions
- Array special type of object.

- Fnctions let you to gethering many statement and put them in it to do one task.

- you can add parameters and return values as you much want to let function do it task.

- object made up from alot of variables and functions.we called on variables as properties and also functions  called  methods.

- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and  methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
